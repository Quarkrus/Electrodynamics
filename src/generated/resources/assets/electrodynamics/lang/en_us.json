The Resistance of a wire will determine how much energy is lost when a current is developed over it. You can use the formula %2$s to to calculate the exact amount of power lost over a wire. However, the resistance listed for a wire is only for a single wire, and machines tend to be more than one block away from each other. Thus a crucial concept is introduced, in that the longer wires are, the higher their overall resistance. In simpler terms, longer wires have a greater power loss. However, if you analyze the equation, you will observe the resistance is only a linear factor where as the current is squared. Thus power loss over a wire is affected far more by the current flowing over it than the resistance of the wire itself. It is crucial to keep this in mind when designing complex wire layouts, as you might lose a great deal of usable energy to the wires before it even reaches the machine.",

It should be noted this survival chance comes at the price of boot durability, so the best practice is still to not touch an exposed wire in the first place.",

  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l17.1": "Now that we know how to get energy to a machine and understand it must be at a specific voltage, you're probably wondering how that voltage is achieved. Most power sources in Electrodynamics are either 120 V or 240 V. This works well for many of the basic machines, but simply won't cut it for more advanced machines that require higher voltages. This is where transformers come in. Transformers function by exchanging voltage for current. This exchange rate can be calculated using what is known as the Turns Ratio, which is given by the formula:",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l17.2": "Where N is the Turns Ratio, Np is the number of primary or input turns, and Ns is the number of secondary or output turns.

This combination of aspects will be referred to as a %1$s moving forward. Operating machines in a grid introduces more complex scenarios that analyzing individual components in a vacuum may overlook.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.2": "To construct a grid, we must first understand how Electrodynamics' electrical model functions. Electrodynamics assumes that all power sources are agregated into one large power source. It then assumes all loads are in series. This can be modeled with the following circuit diagram:",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.3": "This model is not perfect, however it gets the job done, and is about as acurate as you can get without a complex system model using software such as SPICE. Knowing how wire networks are modeled will prove valuable moving forward.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.4": "The first of the more complex concepts that will be introduced is known as Return Current or %1$s. In short, the neutral current means you will lose twice the amount of energy to wire resistance you will think you will lose. While this may sound strange, a detailed examination of how current works will reveal a logical answer. An electrical current requires a return path to its source in order to obey the laws of entropy, that is to say the net electrical charge is zero. In real life, this is accomplished by having a Primary conductor and a Neutral conductor, as can be seen from this image here:",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.5": "The Primary Conductor provides the path for the current to the load, and the Neutral Conductor provides the return path for the current to its source. Electrodynamics does not render a Neutral Conductor, however it assumes that Neutral Conductor is the same length as the Primary Conductor, that is to say the wire you place. Thus the total power loss due to resistance can be calculated as %s. As an aisde, in real life there are techniques that can be used to reduce neutral current, however these techniques are beyond the scope of what Electodynamics is capable of.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.6": "Before we proceed to the next complex topic, I would like to address an elephant in the room. You may be wondering: \"How is it possible that the energy returning to the power source is a net of zero if energy is lost on the way to resistance and also used by a power source.\" The first Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. This applies to electrons as well. If you recall to the first section of this chapter, Voltage was described as the speed of the electricity. The property that will be affected by resistance and load is actually the Voltage. Resistance and load can be thought of as friction slowing the electricity down, the same way a car will eventually come to a stop if you stop accelerating it. This leads to a phenomenon in the real world known as \"Voltage Drop\". Voltage Drop can be a singificant challenge in power delivery, as the load you are serving might have too low of a voltage to run. Fortunately however, Electrodynamics does not simultate Voltage Drop for simplicity's sake.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.7": "The next complex topic that will be covered is known as %1$s. All Electrodynamics machines that use energy have a small internal storage buffer. As they do not have an energy input cap, the empty buffer is seen in its entirety when connected to a live wire. As a result, the current for the device will look akin to the following:",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.8": "In short, the current will briefly spike and quickly approach its steady state level as the buffer is charged. Steady State current is the current you would expect the machine to draw. This buffer is provided to help insulate machines against lag, allowing them to keep running if a tick is skipped by the server. The buffer also coincidentally models a real-world phenomenon, in that all electrical devices store energy. You may find this an odd statement. How can energy be stored without a battery? The answer is that energy is stored in Electrical and Magnetic fields. While the amount is insignificant to the amount of energy that can stored by a battery, it still must be accounted for.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l18.9": "Inrush Current will mostly not affect you fortunately. As discussed previously, while wires have a maximum ampacity that cannot be exceeded, they can handle a brief overload for %s ticks before actually failing. 9 times out of 10 this will not be an issue, however it can become a problem if you have a prolonged inrush that exceeds this time limit. This inrush may also falsely trigger protective devices to trip!",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l19.1": "By now, you are feeling overwhelmed most likely. How are you supposed to keep track of what voltage your grid is operating at? How are you supposed to keep track of the overall resistance? Fear not, for Electrodynamics offers several tools and blocks to assist with this, along with other tools you may find useful. These will be covered on the following pages.",
  "guidebook.electrodynamics.chapter.electricity.l19.circuitbreaker.1": "The Circuit Breaker is a multipurpose block.

The volume of the flow is measured in units of Amperes (Amps for short), and is denoted with a capital I or A. The amount of energy transfered in one second is known as the Power and is measured in units of Watts, denoted with a capital W or P. Power can easily be found through following the formula:",

This means if you power a Pulverizer from Thermal Expansion with a 240 V power source, it will explode! Battery Boxes are also able to accept FE as well as emit it. However, keep in mind if the output voltage is not 120 V, then the FE device will explode!",

As a result, you will find it plays very differently than other tech mods you're used to. The main difference will be that Electro is much more involved, as that is the price that comes with realism. Keep this in mind as you progress in the mod! If you are brand new to this mod, I highly recommend you read the section on Electricity, as it will help you immensely. Another important concept to note is that Electrodynamics is not designed to stand on its own. It is based on the concept of the old Universal Electricity mod, in which you have a mod with basic concepts and technology, and then have several addon mods that hook into those concepts.",
